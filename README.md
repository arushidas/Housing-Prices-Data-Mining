# Housing-Prices-Data-Mining
Predicting Housing Prices in different regions using Data Mining methods on KNIME


### Introduction:
The project aims to develop an accurate predictive model for forecasting real estate prices. The study utilizes data mining techniques, specifically regression analysis, to analyze and predict the sales price of houses. The objective is to identify the factors that significantly influence the price and create a robust and practical predictive model.


### Data Mining Methodology:
The project employs regression techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, which are supervised machine learning approaches. Linear Regression uses a linear model to relate the target variable to dependent variables, while Random Forest Regression utilizes an ensemble strategy with tree-structured predictors. The Knime Analytics Platform, an open-source data mining tool, is used for analysis and modeling.


### Research Gaps:
The study acknowledges the need to thoroughly investigate the data before constructing the prediction model. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the data through exploratory analysis, determining distributions, handling missing values, and visualizing the data. The research highlights the significance of considering factors beyond physical attributes, such as the success of the economy, to accurately forecast property prices.


### Conclusion:
The project demonstrates favorable results in predicting house prices using data mining techniques. Cross-validation with 5-fold iterations improves the accuracy of the models, resulting in better R2 values and reduced RMSE. Linear Regression outperformed Random Forest Regression in this study, but the latter can still provide high predictive value in different circumstances. The study suggests further improvements by incorporating additional variables, such as location details, to capture non-linear relationships.
